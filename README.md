Course: Programming Methodology I
Professor: Yangyong Zhang

Description:
In this project, the goal was to create a simple banking system which allows a banker to manage different bank 
accounts. As a banker, one could create new accounts, deposit to an account, withdraw from an account, transfer 
money from one account to another, delete accounts, sort the accounts, or do inspection on one or all bank 
accounts.
